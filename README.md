## Project Background
Mismanagement of recyclable waste is an environmental disaster and a burden on society. Recycling is an inefficient, costly and risky process. This projectâ€™s purpose is to increase recycling collection rates while also reducing risks for waste management workers and costs for municipalities.We intend to accomplish this goal through three deliverables:

1. Universal Waste Bin Detector
2. Green Screen: Waste Management Dashboard
3. Detecting Rare and Severe Contaminants through Copy-Paste Data Augmentation


## Business Need / Opportunity
Our goal is to develop a product which is able to detect rare and severe contamination in recycling for waste management companies and municipalities. Although they are uncommon, they present safety hazards to workers as well as contaminate recycling. In conjunction with political movements demanding more drastic action on environmental impacts and waste, this project can be used to help society achieve that objective through automation of waste collection facilities.

## Project Deliverables

<details>
<summary>Universal Bin Detector</summary>

The bin detector aims to improve the efficiency of recycling bin detection and allow for rapid scalability of the recycling collection to additional municipalities. This is achieved by creating an object detection model that can be deployed to any waste collection vehicle. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Green Screen: Waste Management Dashboard</summary>

The dashboard strives to build an interactive platform which provides residential recycling collection data analytics and insights to municipalities and stakeholders. Increasing the availability of this information allows the municipality to strategize and evaluate recycling information to reduce costs and inefficiencies.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Copy-Paste Rare Contaminant Detection Pipeline</summary>

Finally, through data augmentation, this project also focuses on detecting rare and severe contaminants which are currently undetectable. Although these contaminants occur rarely in residential recycling, they are critical to detect as they pose serious risks to waste collection workers and surrounding properties. This data augmentation pipeline will be able to generate artificial image datasets of rare contaminants from a few sample images. Our objective is to train machine learning models using the augmented dataset to detect an object which was previously undetectable and mitigate risks.
