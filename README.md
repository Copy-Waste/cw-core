## Project Background
Our projectâ€™s purpose is to increase recycling collection rates and reduce operator costs by identifying severe and rare contaminants at the source. It is difficult to train detection models for rare contaminants as large datasets of images do not exist. Our platform will synthetically create a large image dataset of rare contaminants, allowing it to be possible to train detection models. Detecting these contaminants will lead to safer work environments for waste management workers, educational campaigns for households, reduce costs for municipalities and improve the quality of recycling.

## Business Need / Opportunity
Our goal is to develop a product which is able to detect rare and severe contamination in recycling for waste management companies and municipalities. Although they are uncommon, they present safety hazards to workers as well as contaminate recycling. In conjunction with political movements demanding more drastic action on environmental impacts and waste, this project can be used to help society achieve that objective through automation of waste collection facilities.

## Project Deliverables

1. Universal Bin Detector

2. Green Screen Waste Management Dashboard

3. Copy-Paste Rare Contaminant Detection Pipeline
