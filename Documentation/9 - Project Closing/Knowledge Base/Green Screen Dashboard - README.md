# Green Screen

This project's focus is on sustainability [Goal 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/).

This project is in partnership with [Prairie Robotics](https://www.prairierobotics.com/).

This project is hosted within the Prairie Robotics organization. [Click here to visit the project](https://github.com/proboticsinc/streamsight/tree/10-29-CopyWaste).

## Project Background

Recycling within the City of Regina is heavily contaminated, inefficient, and expensive. These contaminants lead to a significant amount of recyclables being redirected to landfills. This is unsustainable for the city but also unacceptable and irresponsible to actively harm the environment knowing improvements can be made.In its current state, the collected recycling data is difficult to visualize and analyze in order to educate the public effectively on better recycling habits.

## Business Need / Opportunity

I believe there is a large area of improvement in utilizing this data which is being collected regularly and displaying it in a manner in which it is easily digestible to waste management operators. Events for hazardous waste detected in recycling, common contaminants, neighborhoods which tend to contaminate, among other information should all be simple and straightforward to view for waste management workers on a daily basis. This will allow them to create actionable items to improve household recycling rapidly.

As the recycling collection routes are separated based on zones within city and are collected on different days, recycling from each day can be thoroughly analyzed to understand its levels of contamination as well as its rate of success. A representation of this data which currently does not exist for Regina, will help the city understand issues with household recycling and strengthen the waste management program.


## Installation

Note: This project depends on Streamsight-API to retrieve data. Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/proboticsinc/streamsight/blob/master/README.md) to properly install the API and initialize a local database. You will require authorization from Prairie Robotics to establish a secure connection.

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/proboticsinc/streamsight.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

3. Switch to branch 10-29-CopyWaste

    ```sh
    git checkout 10-29-CopyWaste
    ```

4. Run the Application

    ```sh
